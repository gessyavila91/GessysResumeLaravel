# Test Plan

This document outlines the test plan for the application.

## Objectives

The main objectives of the testing phase are:
- To ensure that the application meets the specified functional and non-functional requirements.
- To identify and fix bugs or issues before the application is deployed to production.
- To verify that the application performs well under various conditions and usage scenarios.

## Scope

The scope of testing includes:
- Functional Testing: Verifying that each feature of the application works as intended.
- Non-Functional Testing: Ensuring the application meets performance, security, usability, and other quality standards.
- Integration Testing: Testing the interactions between different modules and components.
- User Acceptance Testing (UAT): Validating the application with end-users to ensure it meets their needs and expectations.

## Test Levels

1. **Unit Testing**
    - Objective: To test individual components or modules in isolation.
    - Tools: PHPUnit for PHP, Jest for JavaScript.

2. **Integration Testing**
    - Objective: To test interactions between integrated components or systems.
    - Tools: PHPUnit for PHP, Postman for API testing.

3. **System Testing**
    - Objective: To test the complete and integrated application as a whole.
    - Tools: Selenium for automated browser testing.

4. **User Acceptance Testing (UAT)**
    - Objective: To validate the application with real users.
    - Tools: Manual testing with test scripts.

## Test Strategy

- **Test Automation**: Automate repetitive and regression tests to ensure efficiency.
- **Manual Testing**: Perform manual testing for exploratory, usability, and UAT.
- **Continuous Integration**: Integrate testing into the CI/CD pipeline to run tests automatically on code changes.

## Test Environment

- **Development Environment**
    - Description: Used by developers to write and unit test their code.
    - Setup: Local machines or Docker containers.

- **Testing Environment**
    - Description: Used by testers to perform various levels of testing.
    - Setup: Dedicated testing server or cloud-based environment.

- **Staging Environment**
    - Description: Mirrors the production environment for final validation before deployment.
    - Setup: Similar configuration to the production environment.
