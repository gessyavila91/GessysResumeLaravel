# Non-Functional Requirements

This document outlines the non-functional requirements of the application.

## Performance
- The application should load within 3 seconds for 95% of the users.
- API responses should be received within 2 seconds.
- The application should handle up to 1,000 concurrent users without performance degradation.

## Scalability
- The application should be designed to scale horizontally to handle an increasing number of users and data.
- The system architecture should support the addition of new features and modules with minimal impact on existing functionalities.

## Security
- All user data must be encrypted at rest and in transit.
- Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms to ensure secure access to the application.
- Regular security audits and vulnerability assessments should be conducted.
- Passwords should be hashed using strong algorithms (e.g., bcrypt).

## Reliability
- The application should have an uptime of 99.9%.
- Implement redundancy and failover mechanisms to ensure high availability.
- Regular backups of user data should be performed to prevent data loss.

## Maintainability
- The codebase should follow standard coding conventions and best practices.
- Documentation for the code, APIs, and system architecture should be comprehensive and up-to-date.
- The application should be modular, allowing easy updates and maintenance.

## Usability
- The application should be user-friendly and intuitive, providing a seamless user experience.
- Ensure accessibility compliance (e.g., WCAG) to accommodate users with disabilities.
- Conduct usability testing to gather feedback and make necessary improvements.

## Portability
- The application should be compatible with different operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux).
- Ensure the application runs smoothly on various web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).

## Interoperability
- The application should integrate seamlessly with third-party services and APIs.
- Data exchange between the application and external systems should follow standard protocols (e.g., REST, JSON).

## Legal and Compliance
- The application must comply with relevant data protection and privacy laws (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).
- Ensure that the terms of service and privacy policy are clear and accessible to users.

## Availability
- The system should be designed to minimize downtime during maintenance and updates.
- Implement monitoring and alerting mechanisms to detect and resolve issues promptly.

## Localization
- The application should support multiple languages and regions.
- Provide a mechanism for users to switch between different languages.

## Disaster Recovery
- A disaster recovery plan should be in place to restore the application in case of major failures.
- Regularly test the disaster recovery plan to ensure its effectiveness.

## Testing and Quality Assurance
- Implement automated testing (unit tests, integration tests, end-to-end tests) to ensure code quality.
- Perform regular performance testing and load testing to identify and fix bottlenecks.
- Conduct code reviews and use static code analysis tools to maintain code quality.
