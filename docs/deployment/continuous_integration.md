# Continuous Integration

This document outlines the continuous integration (CI) setup for the application.

## Objectives

The main objectives of the continuous integration process are:
- To ensure code quality and consistency.
- To automatically run tests and catch bugs early in the development cycle.
- To streamline the deployment process and ensure a smooth transition from development to production.

## Tools and Services

1. **GitHub Actions**: A powerful CI/CD tool integrated with GitHub.
2. **PHPUnit**: For unit testing PHP code.
3. **Mockery**: For creating mock objects in PHP tests.
4. **ESLint**: For linting JavaScript code.
5. **Jest**: For unit testing JavaScript code.

## Workflow

The CI workflow is triggered on every push and pull request to the main branch. It includes the following steps:

### 1. Code Checkout
Check out the code from the repository.
```yaml
- name: Checkout code
  uses: actions/checkout@v2
```

### 2. Set Up PHP

Set up the PHP environment.

yaml

```
- name: Set up PHP
  uses: shivammathur/setup-php@v2
  with:
    php-version: '8.2'
    extensions: mbstring, pdo, pdo_mysql
```

### 3. Install PHP Dependencies

Install PHP dependencies using Composer.

yaml

```
- name: Install dependencies
  run: composer install --prefer-dist --no-progress --no-suggest
```

### 4. Set Up Node.js

Set up the Node.js environment.

yaml

```
- name: Set up Node.js
  uses: actions/setup-node@v2
  with:
    node-version: '12'
```

### 5. Install Node.js Dependencies

Install Node.js dependencies using NPM.

yaml

```
- name: Install dependencies
  run: npm install
```

### 6. Run PHP Unit Tests

Run unit tests for PHP using PHPUnit.

yaml

```
- name: Run PHPUnit tests
  run: ./vendor/bin/phpunit
```

### 7. Run JavaScript Linting

Lint JavaScript code using ESLint.

yaml

```
- name: Run ESLint
  run: npm run lint
```

### 8. Run JavaScript Unit Tests

Run unit tests for JavaScript using Jest.

yaml

```
- name: Run Jest tests
  run: npm test
```

### 9. Build Application

Build the front-end assets using Vite.

yaml

```
- name: Build assets
  run: npm run build
```

### Example GitHub Actions Workflow

Below is an example GitHub Actions workflow configuration (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`):

yaml

```
name: CI

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Set up PHP
      uses: shivammathur/setup-php@v2
      with:
        php-version: '8.2'
        extensions: mbstring, pdo, pdo_mysql

    - name: Install dependencies
      run: composer install --prefer-dist --no-progress --no-suggest

    - name: Set up Node.js
      uses: actions/setup-node@v2
      with:
        node-version: '12'

    - name: Install dependencies
      run: npm install

    - name: Run PHPUnit tests
      run: ./vendor/bin/phpunit

    - name: Run ESLint
      run: npm run lint

    - name: Run Jest tests
      run: npm test

    - name: Build assets
      run: npm run build
```

## Additional Considerations

- **Code Coverage**: Integrate code coverage tools to measure the percentage of code covered by tests.
- **Static Analysis**: Use static analysis tools like PHPStan for PHP and SonarQube for overall code quality.
- **Notifications**: Configure notifications to alert the development team when a build fails or tests do not pass.
